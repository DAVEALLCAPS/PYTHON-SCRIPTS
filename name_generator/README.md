# Random Name Generator
A simple Python script that generates a random name combination by selecting one first name and one last name from two separate CSV files. 
The script reads names from first_names.csv and last_names.csv, and outputs a randomly generated full name each time it is called.

## Usage
1. Create two CSV files, first_names.csv and last_names.csv, in the same directory as the script, each containing a list of names with one name per line.
2. Run the script with the following command:
```
py namegen.py
```
The script will output a random name combination using the names provided in the CSV files.
